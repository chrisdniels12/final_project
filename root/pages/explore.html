                <p id="center">But where did the Muffler Men come from?

If there was a single ancestral birthplace of these hulking highway giants, it has long been shrouded in murk. Today's owners, often five or six times removed from the original purchasers, have little or no information. Were some really seen in the 1940s, as chronicled in our Sightings Reports? Were they fashioned by "some company in California," or dozens of dead and defunct fiberglass makers? Tantalizing clues, and, to be honest, we at first didn't dig too deeply. It seemed better not to know....

According to sculptor Richard Ellis, the first Muffler Man was made by Bobbie Lee "Bob" Prewitt (1919-2009), a rodeo cowboy in Lawndale, California. In 1958 he'd designed a horse trailer, and built a fiberglass horse to stand in it and help sell it. But more people wanted to buy the horse than the trailer, so Bob pivoted and went into the fiberglass animal business, selling cows and steers to dairies and steakhouses.A tribe of titans, made of fiberglass and 14 to 25 feet tall, stands watch along the vibrant roadside landscape. They include exaggerated caricatures of lumberjacks, cowboys, and Indians, but the first statues we spotted held big car mufflers, so we named them "Muffler Men."<br>
